<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello, my name is Very Viranda. I previously worked as a Graphic Designer 
  for over 13 years. The advancement of technology has motivated me to learn more 
  skills in pursuit of my dream to create a website, which might take 
  the form of an online store or a platform that can benefit many people.</p>

<p>I am very passionate about expanding my skills in various fields. 
  I have acquired video editing skills using Adobe Premiere, CapCut, 
  and Adobe After Effects. Additionally, I have a hobby in the 3D world, 
  including architectural design using SketchUp and 3D modeling using Blender.</p>

<p>Through these technological advancements, I thoroughly enjoy the wealth 
  of learning materials readily available, whether through YouTube channels 
  or online learning platforms. I also hope that in the future, 
  I can share my knowledge through existing social media platforms. Thank you!</p>
